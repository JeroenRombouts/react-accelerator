Re-fetching all data each time someone types in the input field isn’t optimal. Since we’re using a third-party API to fetch the data, its internals are out of our reach. Eventually, we will be confronted with <a href="https://bit.ly/2ZaJXI8">rate limiting</a> which returns an error instead of data. To solve this problem, we will change the implementation details from implicit to explicit data (re-)fetching. In other words, the application will refetch data only if someone clicks a confirmation button.

**Task:**The server-side search executes every time a user types into the input field. The new implementation should only execute a search when a user clicks a confirmation button. As long as the button is not clicked, the search term can change but isn’t executed as API request.</p>

<p>
  <strong>Optional Hints:</strong>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add a button element to confirm the search request.</li>
  <li>Create a stateful value for the confirmed search.</li>
  <li>The button’s event handler sets confirmed search as state by using the current search term.</li>
  <li>Only when the new confirmed search is set as state, execute the side-effect to perform a server-side search.</li>
</ul>
