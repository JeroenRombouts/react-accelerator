# React advanced state: useState Hook

Reducers: In essence, a reducer is a function which takes two arguments -- the current state and an action -- and returns based on both arguments a new state.

```tsx
type BooksState = TechBooks;

const booksReducer = (state: BooksState, action: any) => {
  if (action.type === "SET_BOOKS") {
    return action.payload;
  } else {
    throw new Error();
  }
};
```

A reducer will execute logic based on the type of the action it is being passed and will return the new state, not modify the current state.

Remark: action is temporarily typed as `any`. Actions have a type and usually a payload.

Exchange the useState for useReducer for managing the sotires. This hook receives a reducer function and an initial state as arguments and returns an array of 2 arguments: the first is the current state and the second is the state updater function

Turn this

```tsx
const [books, setBooks] = React.useState<TechBooks>([]);
```

into this

```tsx
const [books, dispatchBooks] = React.useReducer(booksReducer, []);
```

instead of explicitly setting the state with setBooks, we can dispatch an Action here to the reducer.

```tsx
React.useEffect(() => {
  setIsloading(true);
  getAsyncBooks()
    .then((result) => {
      dispatchBooks({
        type: "SET_BOOKS",
        payload: result.data.books,
      });
      setIsloading(false);
    })
    .catch(() => setIsError(true));
}, []);
```

In handleRemovebook, we can also change the setbooks call to dispatching an action

```tsx
const handleRemoveBook = (item: TechBook) => {
  const newBooks = books.filter((book: TechBook) => item.id != book.id);
  dispatchBooks({
    type: "SET_BOOKS",
    payload: newBooks,
  });
};
```

alternatively (and if you have only 1 statechange working with a reducer makes no sense), we can make an new action for removing a book.

```tsx
const handleRemoveBook = (item: TechBook) => {
  dispatchBooks({
    type: "REMOVE_BOOK",
    payload: item,
  });
};
```

And we need to update our reducer to handle this action:

```tsx
const booksReducer = (state: BooksState, action: any) => {
  if (action.type === "SET_BOOKS") {
    return action.payload;
  } else if (action.type === "REMOVE_BOOK") {
    return state.filter((book: TechBook) => action.payload.id != book.id);
  } else {
    throw new Error();
  }
};
```

Since we are using typescript we can type this better

```tsx
type TechBooksSetAction = {
  type: "SET_BOOKS";
  payload: TechBooks;
};

type TechBooksRemoveAction = {
  type: "REMOVE_BOOK";
  payload: TechBook;
};

type TechBooksAction = TechBooksSetAction | TechBooksRemoveAction;
```

And make the reducer a bit more readable using a switch statement (you should note during typing that the IDE is helping us because of the typing we just did.)

```tsx
const booksReducer = (state: BooksState, action: TechBooksAction) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "SET_BOOKS":
      return action.payload;
    case "REMOVE_BOOK":
      return state.filter((book: TechBook) => action.payload.id != book.id);
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
};
```
