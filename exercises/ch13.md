To start:

It is best to use the start with the refactored data from this chapters app.tsx. Because we are now going to get data from the Hacker News API, the types are changed to stories and the properties are changed to match too.

to try out the api: copy this in the browser: https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=react And look at what we are getting back.

**Excercise**: rewrite the code so it uses the browser's fetch API, see the docs here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API

    <summary>you can do this without peeking</summary>

```tsx
// add the endpoint for more readable code
const API_ENDPOINT = 'https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=';

...
const App = () => {
...
  React.useEffect(() => {
    dispatchStories({ type: "STORIES_FETCH_INIT" });

    // do the call
    fetch(`${API_ENDPOINT}react`)
        // get the json of the respn
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((result) => {
        // change the property. it is now .hits
        dispatchStories({
          type: "STORIES_FETCH_SUCCESS",
          payload: result.hits,
        });
      })
      .catch(() => dispatchStories({ type: "STORIES_FETCH_FAILURE" }));
  }, []);

```

Try it in the browser. The searching on title still works and so does the delete button.
