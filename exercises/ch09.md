# React Asynchronous Data

Date often needs to come in asynchronously. We need to be able to render a component before we can initiate the data fetching

## using a promis

In the app component we will simulate a fetch from a server, adding a 2 second delay:

```tsx
const App = () => {
  const initialBooks = [...];

...

const getAsyncBooks = (): Promise<{ data: { books: TechBooks } }> =>
  new Promise((resolve) =>
    setTimeout(() => resolve({ data: { books: initialBooks } }), 2000)
  );

```

We will need to set the inital state to an empty array and use a new useEffect hook to call the function and resolve the promise as a sideeffect, but only the first time the component renders

```tsx
const App = () => {
  const initialBooks = [...];

...
// note that we need to type the useState again
// because the tsc can't get it from the initial state.
const [books, setBooks] = React.useState<TechBooks>([]);

// remember that passing an empty array means that it is only called on the initial render
 React.useEffect(() => {
    getAsyncBooks().then((result) => {
      setBooks(result.data.books);
    });
  }, []);


```

When you refresh the browser, you should see that the data only arrives after a delay of 2 seconds.

## refactor

We can move these parts of the data fetching logic outside of the app component:

```tsx
const initialBooks = [
  {
    title: "React",
    url: "https://reactjs.org/",
    author: "Jordan Walke",
    num_comments: 3,
    points: 4,
    id: 0,
  },
  {
    title: "Redux",
    url: "https://redux.js.org/",
    author: "Dan Abramov, Andrew Clark",
    num_comments: 2,
    points: 5,
    id: 1,
  },
];

const getAsyncBooks = (): Promise<{ data: { books: TechBooks } }> =>
  new Promise((resolve) =>
    setTimeout(() => resolve({ data: { books: initialBooks } }), 2000)
  );
```
