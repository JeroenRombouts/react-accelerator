# React side-effects

## use local storage

a side effect: interaction with API's, or html elements with width or heights, or with timers or intervals

an example: the api for the local storage. Whenever the search term changes we want to store it in the local storage, so it is stored between sessions.

```tsx
///in app component:
...
 const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState(
    localStorage.getItem("search") || "react"
  );

...
  const handleSearch = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    setSearchTerm(event.target.value);
    localStorage.setItem('search', event.target.value)
  };


```

What is the problem with this code? What happens when we use the setSeachTerm somewhere else? functionally: the updater function should only update the value, not introduce side-effects.

## Use React's useEffect Hook

useEffect takes 2 arguments:

1. a function that executes the side effect `()=> localStorage.setItem('search', searchTerm)`
2. a dependency array of variables, the function is called when any of these variables change. In our case there is only 1 `[searchTerm]`

note: if you don't give a dependeny array, it is triggered on every render, if you give an empty array it is only triggered on the first render.

```tsx
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState(
  localStorage.getItem("search") || "react"
);

React.useEffect(() => localStorage.setItem("search", searchTerm), [searchTerm]);

const handleSearch = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  setSearchTerm(event.target.value);
};
```

## We did introduce a bug

open the browser and backspace until the search bar is empty. Double check in the applications tab in your dev tools that the value is indeed empty.
Now reopen the browser. Why does it show react? Solve this problem using the ?? operator

<details>
  <summary>A hint</summary>
  An empty string is falsy, i.e. it is converted into false in a boolean statement. The OR operator sees it as false. 
  <details>
  <summary>possible solution</summary>

use the null coalescing operator instead of the OR operator, this will not treat an empty string as null.

```tsx
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState(
  localStorage.getItem("search") ?? "react"
```

  </details>

</details>

## custom hooks

We used 2 hooks up to now: useState and useEffect:

- useState is used to track the values that change over time
- useEffect is used to opt into the lifecycle of a component to introduce side-effects

There are more hooks to come, but now we will make our own custom hook: useStorageState, based on the 2 hooks we already know

Change the line of the useState call in the App component to this:
`const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useStorageState('React'));`

Make the hook itself outside of the app component

```tsx
const useStorageState = (initalState: string) => {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState(
    localStorage.getItem("search") ?? initalState
  );
  React.useEffect(
    () => localStorage.setItem("search", searchTerm),
    [searchTerm]
  );

  return [searchTerm, setSearchTerm];
};
```

conventionally hooks

- have a name that start with use
- returned values are an array
- are reusable

to make them reusable, we can make it more generic:

```tsx
const useStorageState = (initialState: string) => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState(
    localStorage.getItem("value") ?? initialState
  );
  React.useEffect(() => localStorage.setItem("value", value), [value]);

  return [value, setValue];
};
```

And reusable:

```tsx
const useStorageState = (initialState: string) => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState(
    localStorage.getItem("value") ?? initialState
  );
  React.useEffect(() => localStorage.setItem("value", value), [value]);

  return [value, setValue];
};
```

This introduces a typescript error: we can solve this by giving the compiler the return type of our custom hook.

```tsx
const useStorageState = (
  key: string,
  initialState: string
): [string, (newValue: string) => void] => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState(
    localStorage.getItem(key) ?? initialState
  );
  React.useEffect(() => localStorage.setItem(key, value), [value, key]);

  return [value, setValue];
};
```
