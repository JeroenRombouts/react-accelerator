# chapter 2: multiple components

general remark: for the time being we'll keep everything in the same file.

## component declaration

Since this are just functions, we can rewrite them as arrowfunctions. Do this with the App Component. Since it doesn't contain any functionality, you don't even need a return statement.

## splitting up List and Search Components

Make a List Function that return the jsx for everything from (and including) the ul tags and make it appear in the same place by using the List tag

Do the same for the label and the input field, in a function called Search(). Remember why just copy/pasting the html code doesn't work?

your App component should look like this, and still render the same in the browser:

```tsx
const App = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Hacker Stories</h1>

    <Search />

    <hr />

    <List />
  </div>
);
```

<details>
  <summary>Solution List function</summary>
  
 The List function could look like this:

```tsx
const List = () => (
  <ul>
    {books.map((book) => (
      <li key={book.id}>
        <span>
          <a href={book.url}>{book.title}</a>
        </span>
        <span>{book.author}</span>
        <span>{book.num_comments}</span>
        <span>{book.points}</span>
      </li>
    ))}
  </ul>
);
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Solution Search function</summary>
  
 You need a single root element so we wrap this in a div:
```tsx
const Search = () => (
  <div>
    <label htmlFor="search">Search: </label>
    <input className="text-input" id="search" type="text" />
  </div>
);
```
</details>

When you inspect the HTML in the browser's devtools, you don't see the components anywhere. But you should see them in the react dev tools.

## Handler functions

Let's implement a basic search functionality in the search component.

First, we need to change the function back to having a body so we can add the handler function.

Then we can add the HandleChange function. In this case it takes an event of the type React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement> because we are going to use it on an input field.

And to bind it to the field: reference the handler in the onChange.

```tsx
const Search = () => {
  const handleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    console.log(e);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <label htmlFor="search">Search: </label>
      <input
        className="text-input"
        id="search"
        type="text"
        onChange={handleChange}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

Go take a look at the output of that console log in the browser dev tools. What is a synthetic event? And what would e.nativeEvent return?

Add another console.log line after the current one to get the value from the event.

Now we have 2 function calls, we can try out the dev tools debugger. Go to the sources tab and search for the app.tsx file. Put 2 breakpoints on the console logs and try out some of the debug functionality.

## props: passing data to components

lets refactor what we have.

1.  instead of using a class, we can define a Techbook as a type.

```tsx
type TechBook = {
  id: number;
  url: string;
  title: string;
  author: string;
  num_comments: number;
  points: number;
};

type TechBooks = TechBook[];
```

2. move the declaration of the array inside the App function and assign it to the List's props property.

```tsx
type ListProps = {
  list: TechBooks;
};

const App = () => {
  const books = [
    {
      title: "React",
      url: "https://reactjs.org/",
      author: "Jordan Walke",
      num_comments: 3,
      points: 4,
      id: 0,
    },
    {
      title: "Redux",
      url: "https://redux.js.org/",
      author: "Dan Abramov, Andrew Clark",
      num_comments: 2,
      points: 5,
      id: 1,
    },
  ];

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hacker Stories</h1>

      <Search />

      <hr />

      <List list={books} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

3. Next we have to to make the list component accept properties. In this case we will use React.FC (FC stands for Functional Component) to type the props.

```tsx
const List: React.FC<ListProps> = (props) => (
  <ul>
    {props.list.map((book) => (
      <li key={book.id}>
        <span>
          <a href={book.url}>{book.title}</a>
        </span>
        <span>{book.author}</span>
        <span>{book.num_comments}</span>
        <span>{book.points}</span>
      </li>
    ))}
  </ul>
);
```

4. Check in the React dev tools, when you select the List component, you should be able to see the props
5. Make an Item component that shows a book and use that in the List component

<details>
  <summary>possible solution</summary>

```tsx
type ItemProps = {
  item: TechBook;
};

const List: React.FC<ListProps> = (props) => (
  <ul>
    {props.list.map((book) => (
      <Item key={book.id} item={book} />
    ))}
  </ul>
);

const Item: React.FC<ItemProps> = (props) => (
  <li>
    <span>
      <a href={props.item.url}>{props.item.title}</a>
    </span>
    <span>{props.item.author}</span>
    <span>{props.item.num_comments}</span>
    <span>{props.item.points}</span>
  </li>
);
```

</details>

Check the results in the react dev tools.
