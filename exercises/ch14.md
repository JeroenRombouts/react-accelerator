# refetching data

Atm the stories we get back from the api are all react related. And we do a search on the locally fetched data.

Excercise: change the search to fetch searched data from the api.

Hints:

- remove the searchedStories, filtering happens on the server
- instead of searching for 'react' search for searchTerm
- handle the edgecase when searTerm is an empty string.

No example solution her. You can do this yourself.
