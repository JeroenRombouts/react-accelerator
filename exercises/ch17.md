# using a Third-party library

one alternative to the browsers fetch API is Axios

First we need to install it:
`npm install axios`

and import it:
`import axios from "axios";`

Replace the fetch call with the axios call. The get function also takes an url and return a promise. There is no need to do a json transform anymore, axios wraps it in a javascript object called data.

```tsx
axios.get(url).then((result) => {
  dispatchStories({
    type: "STORIES_FETCH_SUCCESS",
    payload: result.data.hits,
  });
});
```

# async/await

The more modern way of working with promisses is async and await.

Try to rewrite the axios code to async await.

```tsx
const handleFetchStories = React.useCallback(async () => {
  dispatchStories({ type: "STORIES_FETCH_INIT" });

  try {
    const result = await axios.get(url);

    dispatchStories({
      type: "STORIES_FETCH_SUCCESS",
      payload: result.data.hits,
    });
  } catch {
    dispatchStories({ type: "STORIES_FETCH_FAILURE" });
  }
}, [url]);
```
