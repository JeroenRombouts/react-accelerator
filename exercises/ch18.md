# Forms

There is no modern application that doesn’t use forms. A form is just a vehicle to submit data via a button from various input controls (e.g. input field, checkbox, radio button, slider). Earlier we introduced a new button to fetch data explicitly with a button click. We’ll advance its use with a proper HTML form, which encapsulates the button and input field for the search term with its label.

Forms aren’t much different in React’s JSX than in HTML. We’ll implement it in two steps

First, wrap the input field and button into an HTML form element:

```tsx
<form onSubmit={onSearchSubmit}>
  <InputWithLabel
    id="search"
    value={searchTerm}
    isFocused
    onInputChange={handleSearchInput}
  >
    <strong>Search:</strong>
  </InputWithLabel>

  <button type="submit" disabled={!searchTerm} onClick={handleSearchSubmit}>
    Submit
  </button>
</form>
```

<p>Instead of passing the <code>handleSearchSubmit()</code> handler to the button, it’s used in the new form element’s <code>onSubmit</code> attribute.

The button receives a new <code>type</code> attribute called <code>submit</code>, which indicates that the form element’s <code>onSubmit</code> handles the click and not the button.

Next, since the handler is used for the form event, it executes <code>preventDefault()</code> additionally on React’s synthetic event. This prevents the HTML form’s native behavior which would lead to a browser reload:</p>

```tsx
const handleSearchSubmit = (event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
  setUrl(`${API_ENDPOINT}${searchTerm}`);

  event.preventDefault();
};
```

An additional benefit is that the button can be triggered by pressing enter.

Excercise:
extract the SearchForm as a separate component.
