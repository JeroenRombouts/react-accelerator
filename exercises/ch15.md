# Memoized functions in React

before any explanation: refactor the code like this:

- move all the date fetching logic from the side-effect into an arrow function expression
- now wrap that function into Reacts useCallback hook

```jsx
const handleFetchStories = React.useCallback(() => {
  if (!searchTerm) return;

  dispatchStories({ type: "STORIES_FETCH_INIT" });

  fetch(`${API_ENDPOINT}${searchTerm}`)
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((result) => {
      dispatchStories({
        type: "STORIES_FETCH_SUCCESS",
        payload: result.hits,
      });
    })
    .catch(() => dispatchStories({ type: "STORIES_FETCH_FAILURE" }));
}, [searchTerm]);
```

- invoke it in the useEffect hook

```tsx
React.useEffect(() => {
  handleFetchStories();
}, [handleFetchStories]);
```

This should not change the functionality of the application, it is just a refactor.

Why did we use useCallback to wrap the function? That hook creates a memoized function every time the useEffect Hook runs again.

If we didn't do this, every time the useEffect was fired, it woud create a new handleFetchStories function every time the app component re-renders. Which would cause the app component to re-render and we would go into an infinite loop of re-renders.

the useCallBack hook only changes the function when one of the values in the dependency array are changed.

Besides that: the datafetching logic can now be used elsewhere.
