# avoiding impossible states

Having multiple useState hooks in a row can lead to an impossible stat

to Try this out change the getAsyncBooks to return an error

```tsx
const getAsyncBooks = (): Promise<{ data: { books: TechBooks } }> =>
  new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(reject, 2000));
```

Look at what happens in the browser:

First the loading indicator appears, then the error message is shown, but because the then method in the useEffect hook is never called, the loading indicator never disappears.

First, try to think how you would solve this using the reducer we have before continuing.

Fortunately, we can group states that belong together from multiple useState and useReducer hooks into a singe useReducer hook.

We can take these:

```tsx
const [books, dispatchBooks] = React.useReducer(booksReducer, []);
const [isloading, setIsloading] = React.useState(false);
const [isError, setIsError] = React.useState(false);
```

and merge them into one useReducer hook (We need to update the BooksState type to make this work)

```tsx
type BooksState = {
  data: TechBooks;
  isLoading: boolean;
  isError: boolean;
};

...

  const [books, dispatchBooks] = React.useReducer(booksReducer, {
    data: [],
    isLoading: false,
    isError: false,
  });

...

  const searchedBooks = books.data.filter((book: TechBook) =>
    book.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())
  );

...

<hr />

{books.isError && <p>Something went wrong...</p>}

{books.isLoading ? (...

```

We will need 3 new actions: one to tell that the action is being fetched and one to tell the the data has been succesfully received (with the data as payload) and another that says that the fetch failed. We can delete the SET_BOOKS action, because it is replace by these three.

```jsx
type TechBooksFetchInitAction = {
  type: "BOOKS_FETCH_INIT",
};

type TechBooksFetchSuccessAction = {
  type: "BOOKS_FETCH_SUCCESS",
  payload: TechBooks,
};

type TechBooksFetchFailureAction = {
  type: "BOOKS_FETCH_FAILURE",
};
```

and we need to add them to the possible types of TechBookAction:

```tsx
type TechBooksAction =
  | TechBooksRemoveAction
  | TechBooksFetchInitAction
  | TechBooksFetchSuccessAction
  | TechBooksFetchFailureAction;
```

now update the useEffect in the appcomponent to:

```tsx
React.useEffect(() => {
  dispatchBooks({ type: "BOOKS_FETCH_INIT" });

  getAsyncBooks()
    .then((result) => {
      dispatchBooks({
        type: "BOOKS_FETCH_SUCCESS",
        payload: result.data.books,
      });
    })
    .catch(() => dispatchBooks({ type: "BOOKS_FETCH_FAILURE" }));
}, []);
```

And we need to handle these actions in the reducer:

```tsx
const booksReducer = (state: BooksState, action: TechBooksAction) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "BOOKS_FETCH_INIT":
      return {
        ...state,
        isLoading: true,
        isError: false,
      };
    case "BOOKS_FETCH_SUCCESS":
      return {
        ...state,
        isLoading: false,
        isError: false,
        data: action.payload,
      };
    case "BOOKS_FETCH_FAILURE":
      return {
        ...state,
        isLoading: false,
        isError: true,
      };
    case "REMOVE_BOOK":
      return {
        ...state,
        data: state.data.filter((book) => action.payload.id !== book.id),
      };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
};
```

<details>
    <summary>Why do you think all return values start with `...state`?</summary>

Before this change the type of state was a simple array. Now it is a complex object. It is good practice to start with spreading the state and tnen changing only those properties that need to be changed. The state is immutable, so you should return a new copy of the complete state

If you refresh the page in the browser, you should see the loading indicator for 2 seconds and then the error indicator alone.
