# Props and state

## An intuitive approach to passing the searchdata to the html

Change the Search component to this:

```tsx
const Search = () => {
  let searchTerm = "";

  const handleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    searchTerm = e.target.value;
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <label htmlFor="search">Search: </label>
      <input
        className="text-input"
        id="search"
        type="text"
        onChange={handleChange}
      />
      <p>
        Searching for <strong>{searchTerm}</strong>
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Try this in the browser. Does this work? Why?

  <summary>why</summary>
  
 React doesn't know that this value is a statefull value. Only when a stateful value changes, React will update the affected component(s)
 
 </details>

## useState

React.useState(x) will take an initial state as parameter and return an Array with 2 entries:

- the first one is the one representing the current state
- the second one is the updater function, that updates the current state

This is a hook: there are many more hooks in React.

**Remarks:**

- you can have multiple statefull values in the same component
- the state can be anything: from a simple string to a complex object

implementing the hook:

```tsx
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState("");

const handleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  setSearchTerm(e.target.value);
};
```

Try it out in the browser. And check the react dev tools too.

Excercise: add a console.log() to every component loging the name of the the component. (Don't forget that fat arrow function with implicit return can't have a function, you need to change them to a function body)

See which component gets rendered

- at start up
- add a second identical List component to the app and see how the startup changes (remove it before continuing)
- when you change the text in the input field.

When the component is rerendered the state is kept in the internal closure instead of being reset.

## Callback handlers

We need to get the changes in the Search component to the the list component.

We need an EventHandler in the App component that is passed as a function (in props) to the Search component that calls back to the App component.

In the Search component we need a new props type with the function call and we need to add the call to handleChange event

```tsx
type SearchProps = {
  onSearch: (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void;
};

const Search: React.FC<SearchProps> = (props) => {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState("");

  const handleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    setSearchTerm(e.target.value);
    props.onSearch(e)
  };

  console.log("Search rendered.");
  return (
...
 );
};

```

In the App component we need an Eventhandler and a callback that will be called when the event is raised in the Search. And we need to give the handler to the Search component via props.

```tsx
const App = () => {
  ...
  console.log("App rendered.");

  const handleSearch = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    console.log(`In App, logging ${event.target.value}`);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hacker Stories</h1>

      <Search onSearch={handleSearch} />

      <hr />

      <List list={books} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

Try it out in the browser, look at the console output.

## Lifting State up

We now have the searchterm in the app component. Now we need to apply it to the books list and pass the result to the list component.

Without adding duplication (like keeping the searchTerm as state in the app component as well as in the Search component), this is not intuitive. And we certainly don't want unnecessary duplication.

Lifting state up, is a good practice. It means that **when several components need to reflect the same changing data it is best to put the shared state up to their closest common ancestor.**

In this case, we should

1. move the searchTerm state to the App component,
2. get the Search component to call the OnSearch from the input tag's onchangeEvent.
3. In the App component add a function called searchedBooks that filters the books based on a part of the title (ignore case)
4. change the list component to receive searchedStories as props

Try to implement this without looking at the result

 A possible solution is this

```tsx
//search component
type SearchProps = {
  onSearch: (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void;
};

const Search: React.FC<SearchProps> = (props) => {
  console.log("Search rendered.");
  return (
    <div>
      <label htmlFor="search">Search: </label>
      <input
        className="text-input"
        id="search"
        type="text"
        onChange={props.onSearch}
      />
    </div>
  );
};

// App component
const App = () => {
  const books = [
    {
      title: "React",
      url: "https://reactjs.org/",
      author: "Jordan Walke",
      num_comments: 3,
      points: 4,
      id: 0,
    },
    {
      title: "Redux",
      url: "https://redux.js.org/",
      author: "Dan Abramov, Andrew Clark",
      num_comments: 2,
      points: 5,
      id: 1,
    },
  ];
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState("");

  console.log("App rendered.");

  const handleSearch = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    setSearchTerm(event.target.value);
  };

  const searchedBooks = books.filter((book) =>
    book.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())
  );

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hacker Stories</h1>

      <Search onSearch={handleSearch} />

      <hr />

      <List list={searchedBooks} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## React controlled components

HTML elemtents come with their own state which is not coupled to react.

We never tell the html element what value it needs to have. Try to initialise the searchTerm with the value 'React'

```tsx
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState("react");
```

What happens?
The search fiels is empty, but the list is filtered. When you look in the dev tools you can see that the app component has the correct State. Once you type someting, the html element has the correct value.

To get the inital value correct in the HTML, we need to tell it about the react state.

first change the Search component and the searchProps to accept an inital value and bind it to the value html attribute of the input tag.

```tsx
type SearchProps = {
  search: string;
  onSearch: (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void;
};

const Search: React.FC<SearchProps> = (props) => {
  console.log("Search rendered.");
  return (
    <div>
      <label htmlFor="search">Search: </label>
      <input
        className="text-input"
        id="search"
        type="text"
        value={props.search}
        onChange={props.onSearch}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

Then change the App component to pass the initial value to the search component

```tsx
<Search search={searchTerm} onSearch={handleSearch} />
```
