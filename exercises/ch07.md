# Imperative React

React is inherently declarative: you tell React what you want to see, not how these elements are created.

However, there are some cases where we need imperative access to rendered elements. As an example, set the autofocus property on the InputWithLabel. autofocus is the HTML name, in react it is called autoFocus. (just like in html, adding it is the same as setting it to true)

```tsx
<>
  <label htmlFor={id}>{children}</label>
  &nbsp;
  <input id={id} type={type} value={value} autoFocus onChange={onInputChange} />
</>
```

This should work. But we just tried to make this component more reusable. Do you see the problem?

If you add a second identical element to the app component, which one will get the focus?

<details><summary>2 labels</summary>
change the code to

```tsx
<div>
  <h1>Hacker Stories</h1>

  <InputWithLabel id="search" value={searchTerm} onInputChange={handleSearch}>
    <strong>Search:</strong>
  </InputWithLabel>

  <InputWithLabel id="search" value={searchTerm} onInputChange={handleSearch}>
    <strong>Search:</strong>
  </InputWithLabel>
  <hr />

  <List list={searchedBooks} />
</div>
```

It is the last one that gets the focus, because they are rendered in order

</details>

The obvious declarative answer is to give a prop to the component, so a developer can say wheter is gets focus or not. The code below sets the first InputWithLabel to get the autofocus

```tsx
type InputWithLabelProps = {
  id: string;
  value: string;
  type?: string;
  onInputChange: (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void;
  isFocused?: boolean;
  children: React.ReactNode;
};

const InputWithLabel: React.FC<InputWithLabelProps> = ({
  id,
  value,
  type = "text",
  onInputChange,
  isFocused,
  children,
}) => (
  <>
    <label htmlFor={id}>{children}</label>
    &nbsp;
    <input
      id={id}
      type={type}
      value={value}
      autoFocus={isFocused}
      onChange={onInputChange}
    />
  </>
);
```

and in the app component:

````tsx
<div>
  <h1>Hacker Stories</h1>

  <InputWithLabel
    id="search"
    value={searchTerm}
    onInputChange={handleSearch}
    isFocused
  >
    <strong>Search:</strong>
  </InputWithLabel>

  <InputWithLabel
    id="search"
    value={searchTerm}
    onInputChange={handleSearch}
  >
    <strong>Search:</strong>
  </InputWithLabel>
  <hr />

  <List list={searchedBooks} />
</div>
    ```
````

But we were looking for the imperative to do this.

To do this we need to

- create a ref with React's useRef Hook. The ref value is persisten, but it has e current property than can be changed:
  `const inputRef = React.useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);`
- We need to pass the ref to the JSX ref attribute. This assigns the instance with the value of the current property of ref
  `ref={inputRef}`
- opt into the lifecycle with the useEffect Hook => to set the focus on change and execute the focus programatically as a sideEffect (when isFocused is set)

```tsx
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (isFocused && inputRef.current) {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  }
}, [isFocused]);
```

This approach is not that common.

```tsx
const InputWithLabel: React.FC<InputWithLabelProps> = ({
  id,
  value,
  type = "text",
  onInputChange,
  isFocused,
  children,
}) => {
  const inputRef = React.useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (isFocused && inputRef.current) {
      inputRef.current.focus();
    }
  }, [isFocused]);

  return (
    <>
      <label htmlFor={id}>{children}</label>
      &nbsp;
      <input
        id={id}
        type={type}
        value={value}
        ref={inputRef}
        onChange={onInputChange}
      />
    </>
  );
};
```

Set the focus on the second InputWithLabel. check that it works. Now you can remove the first InputWithLabel in the App component. We don't need it anymore.

if you have time: you can learn more by following along with this tutorial in a new project: [make a slider with a ref in React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-slider/) note: it's in Javascript, not in Typescript.
